## Architecture Decisions

**Framework**  
React with Redux, Thunk, and immutable. This is the configuration I am most familiar with, although I am curiout about replacing Thunk with Redux-Saga.

**Scaffolding**  
Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Takes care of the babel/webpack setup and config - allowing me to focus on the app logic.

**Testing**  
Using Jest - it works well with React and is pretty standard/popular these days.
